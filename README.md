## üíª How we built Rainfy

We created 2 smart contracts in Solidity, [**Rainfy.sol**](https://github.com/iamendy/rainfy/blob/main/contracts/Rainfy.sol) and [**RainfyToken.sol**](https://github.com/iamendy/rainfy/blob/main/contracts/RainfyToken.sol).

- The Rainfy handles the piggy bank creation, management and breaking after duration. This contract is deployed on Gnosis Chain -

- The RainfyToken is used for rewarding users who successfully save and also serves as a dApp utility token. It is an ERC20 token that users earn when they successfully achieve their savings goal [View on Gnosis Chiado](https://gnosis-chiado.blockscout.com/address/0x5A505E3f96bB4d322aaA9Eb81d82B330DB2dAA85)

For the front end, We used **`NextJs/Typescript`**, **`Wagmi`**, **`Rainbowkit`**, **`Prisma`** and **`TailwindCSS`** .

Rainfy integrates with Monerium which allows easy Euro, USD and GBP onRamp, thereby allowing users to basically save their fiat on-chain.

## üöÄ Accomplishments that we're proud of

üç• Implemented an idea that was birthed from our personal pain point.<br />
üç• Deployed our dApp on the Gnosis network which means we will have the best of speed, cost and mobility for our users. <br />
üç• Had fun, and learnt a whole lot building our solution. <br />

## üìà What's next for Rainfy

We're excited to have built this dApp. To enable more web3 users have on-demand access to the best savings platform. We plan on:

- Introduce more usecases for Rainfy token as incentives for users to save more.
- Adding services like loan protocols, utility bills settlent, and staking to increase utilities as well as on-chain invesment options.
