## üíª How we built Rainfy

We created 2 smart contracts in Solidity, [**Rainfy.sol**](https://github.com/iamendy/rainfy/blob/main/contracts/Rainfy.sol) and [**RainfyToken.sol**](https://github.com/iamendy/rainfy/blob/main/contracts/RainfyToken.sol).

- The Rainfy handles the piggy bank creation, management and breaking after duration. This contract is deployed on Gnosis Chain and enables

3. Earn RAIN token. RAIN serves as a dApp utility token. It is an ERC20 token that users earn when they successfully achieve their savings goal [View on Gnosis Chiado](https://gnosis-chiado.blockscout.com/address/0x5A505E3f96bB4d322aaA9Eb81d82B330DB2dAA85)

For the dApp, We used **`NextJs/Typescript`**, **`Wagmi`**, **`Rainbowkit`**, **`Prisma`**, **`TailwindCSS`**, **`NextJs/PostgresSQL`** and **`Monerium SDK`**.

Rainfy integrates with Monerium which allows easy conversion of fiat Euro, USD and GBP into their stablecoin equivalent. Givvie then enables users to basically save their fiat on-chain and access financial benefits.

## üöÄ Accomplishments that we're proud of

üç• Implemented an idea that was birthed from our personal pain point.<br />
üç• Deployed our dApp on the Gnosis network which means we will have the best of speed, cost and mobility for our users. <br />
üç• Had fun, and learnt a whole lot building our solution. <br />

## üìà What's next for Rainfy

We're excited to have built this dApp. To enable more web3 users have the best savings platform without hidden and overhead cost offered by traditional banks. We plan on:

- Integrate decentralized loan protocols and utility bills settlement with RAIN token.
- Add a liquidity pool that users can easily exchange RAIN Token for xDAI.
- Implement smart wallet to allow better user experience managing savings as well as gasless transactions.
- Help our users increase their overall financial habits on-chain
